Engine Design Pattern
=============

To be properly rendered by the engine's parse, all files must follow the following design pattern. If you don't the sky might fall when you try and open the engine output file.

    /*
    Name: Title of sheet
    Version: 1 (all sheets should start at version 1 for inital release)
    Desc: Your description here.
    */
    
    // Name of the object, makes sure that it gets created properly
    var cp = cp || {};
    
    cp.objectName = {
        exampleExtendableMethod: Class.extend({
            exampleVar: 'a',
            exampleFunction: function() {
                // Code here
            }
        },
        nonExtendableMethod: {
            // Code here
        }
    };
