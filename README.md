# Setup

## Run requirements

* NodeJS and NodeNPM with the Express package
* Use Cloud9 (http://c9.io) if you want this to work out of the box without any additional setup
* Express NPM package automatically taken care of if you use Cloud9

## Configuring the setup file

To activate your copy of the game you must create a run file. The run file must be manually created to prevent overwriting other devleoper's environments.

1. Make of copy of js/setup.diff in the exact same folder
2. Rename the copy setup.js
3. Add your own custom setup.js code
4. Run index.html and the game should run as expected
